# DSU GenCyber Auto Elective Script/App

### I'm pretty much done developing this script for the 2023 GenCyber DSU camp. I will maybe make a web app and make it a little bit more pretty in 2024/2025.

What Does It Do?
  - This script allows the user to select their desired electives for the next elective phase in the Dakota State University GenCyber Camp. Then it automatically waits for the electives to open (usually either 7:30 AM or 6:30 AM). At the exact elective time, it registers all the electives for the user, assuming the user is sleep ;)

Why?
  - I was tired that all the electives would fill up immediately at 6:35-40 and I too wanted the best electives so I made this to combat that.

Installation:

1. git clone https://github.com/byrchbaker/DSU-GenCyber.git

2. python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

3. python main.py
